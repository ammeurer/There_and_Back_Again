There and Back Again is a web app created by Amanda Meurer. Amanda is passionate about using big data to influence everyday decisions. She set out to create the ultimate pedestrian routing app. This repository is the result of several weeks' work, and weights routes based on crime densities in San Francisco. In the future Amanda hopes to pull in more datasets (elevation, lighting, construction, coffee shop locations, etc) to craft the optimum walking experience for any user. She would also like to make a mobile app version.
